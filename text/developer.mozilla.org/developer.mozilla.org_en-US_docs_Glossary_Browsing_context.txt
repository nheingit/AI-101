In modern browsers, it usually is a tab, but can be a window or even only parts of a page, like a frame or an iframe.
Each browsing context has an origin (that of the active document) and an ordered history of previously displayed documents.
Communication between browsing contexts is severely constrained. Between browsing contexts of the same origin, a BroadcastChannel can be opened and used.See also
