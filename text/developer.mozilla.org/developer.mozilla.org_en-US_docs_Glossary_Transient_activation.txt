  This state is sometimes used as a mechanism for ensuring that a web API can only function if triggered by user interaction.
  For example, scripts cannot arbitrarily launch a popup that requires transient activation â âit must be triggered from a UI element's event handler.

See Features gated by user activation for examples of APIs that require transient activation.
See the UserActivation.isActive property to programmatically access the current window's transient activation state.

Note: Transient activation expires after a timeout (if not renewed by further interaction), and may also be "consumed" by some APIs. See Sticky activation for a user activation that doesn't reset after it has been set initially.
