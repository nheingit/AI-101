Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

  The UIEvent.initUIEvent() method initializes a UI event
  once it's been created.


  Events initialized in this way must have been created with the Document.createEvent() method. This method must be called to set the event
  before it is dispatched, using EventTarget.dispatchEvent(). Once
  dispatched, it doesn't do anything anymore.


Warning: Do not use this method anymore as it is deprecated.
Instead use specific event constructors, like UIEvent(). The page on Creating and triggering events gives more information about the way to use these.
SyntaxinitUIEvent(type, canBubble, cancelable, view, detail)
Parameters
type

A string defining the type of event.

canBubble


      A boolean value deciding whether the event should bubble up through the
      event chain or not. Once set, the read-only property Event.bubbles
      will give its value.
    

cancelable


      A boolean value defining whether the event can be canceled. Once set, the
      read-only property Event.cancelable will give its value.
    

view

Is the WindowProxy associated with the event.

detail


      An unsigned long specifying some detail information about the
      event, depending on the type of event. For mouse events, it indicates how many times
      the mouse has been clicked on a given screen location.
    

Return valueNone (undefined).Examplesconst e = document.createEvent("UIEvent");
// creates a click event that bubbles, can be cancelled,
// and with its view and detail property initialized to window and 1,
// respectively
e.initUIEvent("click", true, true, window, 1);

    too.
