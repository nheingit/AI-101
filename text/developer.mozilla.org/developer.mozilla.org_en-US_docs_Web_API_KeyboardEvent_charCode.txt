Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

  The charCode read-only property of the
  KeyboardEvent interface returns the Unicode value of a character key
  pressed during a keypress event.



Warning: Do not use this property, as it is deprecated. Instead, get the
    Unicode value of the character using the key
    property.

JavaScriptconst input = document.querySelector("input");
const log = document.querySelector("#log");

input.addEventListener("keypress", (e) => {
  log.innerText = `Key pressed: ${String.fromCharCode(e.charCode)}\ncharCode: ${
    e.charCode
  }`;
});
ResultNotes

    In a keypress event, the Unicode value of the key pressed is stored in
    either the keyCode or charCode
    property, but never both. If the key pressed generates a character (e.g., 'a'),
    charCode is set to the code of that character; charCode
    respects the letter case (in other words, charCode takes into account
    whether the
    shift
    key is held down). Otherwise, the code of the pressed key
    is stored in keyCode.
  

    When one or more modifier keys are pressed, there are some complex rules for
    charCode. See Gecko Keypress Event
    for details.
  

charCode is never set in the keydown and
    keyup events. In these cases, keyCode is set instead.
  

    To get the code of the key regardless of whether it was stored in
    keyCode or charCode, query the which property.
  

    Characters entered through an IME do not register through keyCode or
    charCode.
  

    For a list of the charCode values associated with particular keys, run
    Example 7: Displaying Event Object Properties and view the resulting HTML table.
