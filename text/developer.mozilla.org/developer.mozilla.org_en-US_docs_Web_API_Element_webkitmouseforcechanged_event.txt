wheelInheritance:NodeEventTargetIn this articleSyntaxEvent typeEvent propertiesSpecificationsBrowser compatibilitySee alsoElement: webkitmouseforcechanged eventNon-standard: This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.
The non-standard webkitmouseforcechanged event is fired by Safari each time the amount of pressure changes on the trackpad/touchscreen.
webkitmouseforcechanged is a proprietary, WebKit-specific event introduced by Apple to support their Force Touch events feature.
This event first fires after the mousedown event and stops firing before the mouseup event.SyntaxUse the event name in methods like addEventListener(), or set an event handler property.
addEventListener("webkitmouseforcechanged", (event) => {});

onwebkitmouseforcechanged = (event) => {};
Event typeA MouseEvent. Inherits from Event.

Event propertiesThis interface also inherits properties of its parents, UIEvent and Event.

MouseEvent.altKey Read only 

Returns true if the alt key was down when the mouse event was fired.

MouseEvent.button Read only 

The button number that was pressed (if applicable) when the mouse event was fired.

MouseEvent.buttons Read only 

The buttons being pressed (if any) when the mouse event was fired.

MouseEvent.clientX Read only 

The X coordinate of the mouse pointer in local (DOM content) coordinates.

MouseEvent.clientY Read only 

The Y coordinate of the mouse pointer in local (DOM content) coordinates.

MouseEvent.ctrlKey Read only 

Returns true if the control key was down when the mouse event was fired.

MouseEvent.layerX 
Non-standard
 Read only 

Returns the horizontal coordinate of the event relative to the current layer.

MouseEvent.layerY 
Non-standard
 Read only 

Returns the vertical coordinate of the event relative to the current layer.

MouseEvent.metaKey Read only 

Returns true if the meta key was down when the mouse event was fired.

MouseEvent.movementX Read only 

The X coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the position of the last mousemove event.

MouseEvent.movementY Read only 

The Y coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the position of the last mousemove event.

MouseEvent.offsetX Read only 

The X coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the position of the padding edge of the target node.

MouseEvent.offsetY Read only 

The Y coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the position of the padding edge of the target node.

MouseEvent.pageX Read only 

The X coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the whole document.

MouseEvent.pageY Read only 

The Y coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the whole document.

MouseEvent.relatedTarget Read only 

The secondary target for the event, if there is one.

MouseEvent.screenX Read only 

The X coordinate of the mouse pointer in global (screen) coordinates.

MouseEvent.screenY Read only 

The Y coordinate of the mouse pointer in global (screen) coordinates.

MouseEvent.shiftKey Read only 

Returns true if the shift key was down when the mouse event was fired.

MouseEvent.mozPressure 
Non-standard
 
Deprecated
 Read only 


      The amount of pressure applied to a touch or tablet device when generating the event; this value ranges between 0.0 (minimum pressure) and 1.0 (maximum pressure).
      Instead of using this deprecated (and non-standard) property, you should use PointerEvent and look at its pressure property.
    

MouseEvent.mozInputSource 
Non-standard
 Read only 


      The type of device that generated the event (one of the MOZ_SOURCE_* constants).
      This lets you, for example, determine whether a mouse event was generated by an actual mouse or by a touch event (which might affect the degree of accuracy with which you interpret the coordinates associated with the event).
    

MouseEvent.webkitForce 
Non-standard
 Read only 

The amount of pressure applied when clicking.

MouseEvent.x Read only 

Alias for MouseEvent.clientX.

MouseEvent.y Read only 

Alias for MouseEvent.clientY.
