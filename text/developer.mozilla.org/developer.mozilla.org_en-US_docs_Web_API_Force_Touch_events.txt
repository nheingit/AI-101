Force Touch events are a proprietary, Apple-specific feature which makes possible (where supported by the input hardware) new interactions based on how hard the user clicks or presses down on the touchscreen or trackpad.Events
webkitmouseforcewillbegin 
Non-standard


This event is fired before the mousedown event. Its main use is that it can be Event.preventDefault()ed.

webkitmouseforcedown 
Non-standard


This event is fired after the mousedown event as soon as sufficient pressure has been applied for it to qualify as a "force click".

webkitmouseforceup 
Non-standard


This event is fired after the webkitmouseforcedown event as soon as the pressure has been reduced sufficiently to end the "force click".

webkitmouseforcechanged 
Non-standard


This event is fired each time the amount of pressure changes. This event first fires after the mousedown event and stops firing before the mouseup event.
