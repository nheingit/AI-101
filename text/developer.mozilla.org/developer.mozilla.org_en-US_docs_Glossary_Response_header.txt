Response headers, like Age, Location or Server are used to give a more detailed context of the response.
Not all headers appearing in a response are categorized as response headers by the specification. For example, the Content-Type header is a representation header indicating the original type of data in the body of the response message (prior to the encoding in the Content-Encoding representation header being applied). However, "conversationally" all headers are usually referred to as response headers in a response message.
The following shows a few response and representation headers after a GET request.
