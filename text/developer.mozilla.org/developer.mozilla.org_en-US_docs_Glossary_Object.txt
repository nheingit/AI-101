With the object literal syntax, a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures. Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either a String value or a Symbol value.
There are two types of object properties: The data property and the accessor property.

Note: It's important to recognize it's accessor property â not accessor method. We can give a JavaScript object class-like accessors by using a function as a value â but that doesn't make the object a class.
