  The UIEvent.sourceCapabilities read-only property returns
  an instance of the InputDeviceCapabilities interface which provides
  information about the physical device responsible for generating a touch event. If no
  input device was responsible for the event, it returns null.


  When a single user interaction with an input device generates a series of different
  input events, the sourceCapabilities property for all of them will point to
  the same instance of InputDeviceCapabilities. For example, when a user
  lifts their finger off of a touchscreen, several UIEvents may be generated including
  touchend, mousedown, click, and
  focus. All of these events must have the same
  sourceCapabilities representing the touchscreen.


  A device is considered "responsible" for an event only when that interaction is part of
  the abstraction provided by the web platform. For example, many user agents allow a
  window to be resized with a mouse or a keyboard, but this detail is not exposed to the
  web platform in any way, and so the sourceCapabilities of a resize event will typically
  be null.
