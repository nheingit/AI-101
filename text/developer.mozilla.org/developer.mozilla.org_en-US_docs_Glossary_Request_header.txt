For example, the Accept-* headers indicate the allowed and preferred formats of the response. Other headers can be used to supply authentication credentials (e.g. Authorization), to control caching, or to get information about the user agent or referrer, etc.
Not all headers that can appear in a request are referred to as request headers by the specification. For example, the Content-Type header is referred to as a representation header.
In addition, CORS defines a subset of request headers as simple headers, request headers that are always considered authorized and are not explicitly listed in responses to preflight requests.
The HTTP message below shows a few request headers after a GET request:
