The user initiates a drag by placing a pointer device (such as a mouse) on the touch surface and then dragging the pointer to a new location (such as another DOM element). Applications are free to interpret a drag and drop interaction in an application-specific way.
This interface inherits properties from MouseEvent and Event.

Instance properties
DragEvent.dataTransfer Read only 

The data that is transferred during a drag and drop interaction.

ConstructorsAlthough this interface has a constructor, it is not possible to create a useful DataTransfer object from script, since DataTransfer objects have a processing and security model that is coordinated by the browser during drag-and-drops.

DragEvent()

Creates a synthetic and untrusted DragEvent.

Event types
drag

This event is fired when an element or text selection is being dragged.

dragend

This event is fired when a drag operation is being ended (by releasing a mouse button or hitting the escape key).

dragenter

This event is fired when a dragged element or text selection enters a valid drop target.

dragleave

This event is fired when a dragged element or text selection leaves a valid drop target.

dragover

This event is fired continuously when an element or text selection is being dragged and the mouse pointer is over a valid drop target (every 50 ms WHEN mouse is not moving ELSE much faster between 5 ms (slow movement) and 1ms (fast movement) approximately. This firing pattern is different than mouseover ).

dragstart

This event is fired when the user starts dragging an element or text selection.

drop

This event is fired when an element or text selection is dropped on a valid drop target.
