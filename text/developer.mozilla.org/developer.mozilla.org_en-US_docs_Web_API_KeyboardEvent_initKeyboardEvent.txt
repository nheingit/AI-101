Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

  The KeyboardEvent.initKeyboardEvent() method initializes
  the attributes of a keyboard event object. This method was introduced in draft of DOM
  Level 3 Events, but deprecated in newer draft. Gecko won't support this feature since
  implementing this method as experimental broke existing web apps (see Firefox bug 999645).
  Web applications should use constructor instead of this if it's available.

Return valueNone (undefined).SpecificationsSpecificationUI Events # dom-keyboardevent-initkeyboardeventThe KeyboardEvent interface specification went through numerous draft versions, first under DOM Events Level 2 where it was dropped as no consensus arose, then under DOM Events Level 3. This led to the implementation of non-standard initialization methods, the early DOM Events Level 2 version, KeyboardEvent.initKeyEvent() by Gecko browsers and the early DOM Events Level 3 version, KeyboardEvent.initKeyboardEvent() by others. Both have been superseded by the modern usage of a constructor: KeyboardEvent().Browser compatibilityBCD tables only load in the browser with JavaScript enabled.
